# micro-lab
This repository contains projects in context of the microprocessor lab course in Electrical and Computer Engineering (NTUA). These projects were implemented using 8085/8086/ARM programming lnaguages.

The first 3 series contain projects regarding 8085/8086 Assembly.
Series 4-8 contain the following ARM implementations:

1. Driving LEDs using switches
2. Counting using Interrupt routines
3. Keyboard input - Screen output
4. Logical gates simulation
5. Home Security System implementation featuring control panel, LCD module and counter countdowns.
6. Driver implementation for thermal sensors.
