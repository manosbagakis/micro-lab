# micro-lab
This repository contains projects in context of the microprocessor lab course in Electrical and Computer Engineering (NTUA). These projects were implemented using 8085/8086/ARM programming lnaguages.

The first 3 series contain projects regarding 8085/8086 Assembly.
Series 4-8 contain the following ARM implementations:

1. Driving LEDs using switches
2. Counting using Interrupt routines
3. Keyboard input - Screen output
4. Logical gates simulation
5. Home Security System implementation featuring control panel, LCD module and counter countdowns.
6. Driver implementation for thermal sensors.


These projects were created by the following team:

1. [Arvanitis Christos](https://github.com/arvchristos)
2. [Bagakis Manos](https://github.com/manosbagakis)
